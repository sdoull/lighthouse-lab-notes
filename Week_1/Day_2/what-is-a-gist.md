# So what's a gist anyway?
Steps for creating one with forking method
1. Browse to the gist you'd like to clone
2. Click the Fork button near the top right corner.
(You'll be redirected to your own personal fork of this gist.)
3. Copy the SSH URL of the gist so that you can clone it.
4. Now clone the URL we copied from the gist page using the following command (don't copy/paste the below):

``` git clone git@gist.github.com:YOUR_FORKS_ID.git aName```

5. Go into the "aName" directory and verify that things worked out well for you.
